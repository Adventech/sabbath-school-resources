title: Your Role as a Parent
---

As a parent, you are your baby’s first teacher, mentor, and guide. This means that you are really important to help shape their journey with Jesus, and your home environment is an ideal place for everyday learning. An important part of your role is to establish a regular worship routine in your home, in which you repeat the lessons shared in Sabbath School with your baby. This repetition throughout the week means that your baby will begin to recognize, absorb, and interact with the ideas they also experience at church in Sabbath School.

As your baby grows, prioritizing special time with your little one in worshipping Jesus will be as important as your own personal devotional time with Him. In these formative years this habit of worship will provide a powerful model that will invite a gradual move toward personal ownership of their devotional time with their forever Friend, Jesus.

When they are entrusted with children, it is the same as though Christ placed them in their arms and said, ‘Train these children for Me, that they may shine in the courts of God.’ One of the first sounds that should attract their attention is the name of Jesus, and in their earliest years they should be led to the footstool of prayer. Their minds should be filled with stories of the life of the Lord, and their imaginations encouraged in picturing the glories of the world to come”.
