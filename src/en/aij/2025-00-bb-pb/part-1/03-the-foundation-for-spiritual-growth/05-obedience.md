Obedience can be learned more easily when your baby has first learned love and trust. As a parent, you have control over their life, because you make all the decisions about their daily experiences. These repeated experiences become habits and routines. Routines bring security and happiness to them, making it easier for them to obey you.

Ellen G. White offers much wisdom about the importance of teaching your little one to obey. In section 4 of the book _Child Guidance_ she says, “One of the first lessons a child needs to learn is the lesson of obedience. Before he is old enough to reason, he may be taught to obey” (p. 82). Elsewhere in _Child Guidance_ she says, “The first three years is the time in which to bend the tiny twig [forming character]. Mothers should understand the importance attaching to this period. It is then that the foundation is laid. If you have waited until your children were three years old to begin to teach them self-control and obedience, seek to do it now, even though it will be much harder” (p. 194).

It’s important for parents to agree together on the rules and boundaries for their child. Your consistency as parents will help them to develop obedience and self-control. If you enforce the rules only occasionally, your baby will become confused. Organize a daily routine for them, as this will help them understand the first simple rule of life: there is a time to sleep, a time to play, and a time to eat.

As your baby begins to crawl or walk, in their curiosity and need for adventure they will want to stretch their wings and explore forbidden places, or touch and do what is not allowed. At this stage, do everything possible to make it easy and attractive for your baby to keep your rules. With their willpower still under development, removing dangerous or “tempting” things from their world will be an advantage. Teaching obedience takes much patience and consistent persistence. What you do in these valuable early years will stand you in good stead for the future. Do all you can to make it easy for your little one to obey quickly and happily. The best place to teach obedience is in the security of the home. Devote time in your day to specifically teach love and obedience through play and different interactions.

As your baby grows and their world enlarges, you will come to know which of their cries indicates they have a need, and which of their cries come from their determination to get what they want. When you say “No,” and they look you in the eye and do it anyway, this is the time to be consistent and remind them and enforce your rules in a warm, polite, respectful, calm, and consistent way, with a smile on your face. Explain why they must not do something, as if they can understand you. Use soft, short, clear, and firm phrases. Following through every time will be taxing, but this is so essential when they are young.

As your baby becomes a toddler and grows older, use the principles of natural consequence rather than punishment. Let them know that their choice has invited the consequence, and then faithfully follow through with the consequences that you have explained to them.

**^[TIP]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})**: Your baby wants to touch a pot with hot soup in it. You tell them not to, because it’s hot. They reach up to touch it, and you let them experience the heat, rather than pulling their hand away.

Although we don’t like to see our children in pain or danger, when the risk is not great, it is helpful for them to learn for themselves the natural consequences of their disobedience. Many times this teaches them more than our warning does.
