Props and objects are great tools to use when teaching stories and lessons to your baby. We suggest you choose a box or basket to use as a special Worship Box for your little one. This box will hold all the items you need to help you reinforce the themes.

Some churches may provide you with the option of purchasing the Alive in Jesus Baby Worship Box. If this is not available to you, you may like to make up one of your own or improvise using the resources listed below. Choose objects that have different textures, bright colors, and make sounds, ensuring that safety is a priority. Don’t worry if you don’t have a lot of toys. Remember that the best toys are found in nature, and you can also use some of the safe items you already have in your home. When you go out for a walk, look for natural objects that can be your learning materials—making sure that safety is your first priority.

As your baby grows, and you use more and more objects from the box, place them in the order that follows the routine of the story and songs from Sabbath School. Keep the Worship Box out of reach of your baby and other children during the rest of the day, and bring it out only for worship time. This way the box will become special, and your baby will associate it with your precious worship time together.
