Because you’re the object of His love, God isn’t interested in just your spiritual life. He’s interested in all aspects of your life, which includes your physical, emotional, and mental health.

In order for you to be a healthy parent who will model God’s love to your baby, you need to find time to invest in yourself. The flight attendant’s call to “put on your own oxygen mask before assisting children” is never more real than now. This may seem an impossible task when you’ve not had a full night’s sleep in months. Very early on, you’ll come to know that if you can sleep at night, it’ll be much easier to face your day with courage and positivity. Self-care needs to be a priority.

Healthy eating, drinking more water, fresh air, and regular exercise will help your mind and body and will sustain you during the challenging days. And during those weeks when you’re sleep-deprived and feeling empty, when you don’t succeed in eating healthy, when you don’t drink enough water or manage to exercise enough, remember that tomorrow is a new day. Look for small ways to care for yourself, remembering that even a short walk is better than no walk at all. Find ways to fill your own emotional tank through conversations with extended family or friends, a mentor, and other parents.

Tips for a Physical Recharge:

+ **Lower your expectations** of keeping the house and kitchen clean and doing a lot of other housework. Although having an orderly home is good, your priority is to be rested and happy to take care of your baby.
+ **Try to sleep when your baby sleeps**.
+ **Try to eat a healthy plant-based diet** and drink plenty of water.
+ **Take your baby with you** as you do certain tasks (e.g., gardening or exercising). You can sing to them as you do this.
+ **Take turns with your spouse** to care for your baby while the other one exercises, takes care of some errands, or rests. If you are a single parent, have courage to ask a church member to care for your baby (even for one hour) while you recharge. You may be surprised at how willing others are to help you.
+ **When you are overwhelmed and alone, ask for help** from someone you trust to watch your baby at home while you take a nap for an hour, and sleep without feeling guilty.

Tips for an Emotional Recharge:

Depending on your culture, you might have a constant stream of family coming and going with many offers of help for your baby, or you might feel like parenting is lonely and hard. Regardless of however it is for you, take time to care for yourself. Here are a few tips that may help:

+ **Try listening to inspirational podcasts** if it seems impossible to find some time to read. You can listen while you do your daily parenting tasks.
+ **Make the most of any “micro-moments”** that can refuel your emotional tank. Grasp them rather than let them slip by.
+ **Surround yourself with community**. Find a mothers’/fathers’ group, or a small group in your church in which you can interact with others. Knowing there are others walking the same path can make all the difference to your emotional and mental health.
+ **Ask for help if you need it and learn to accept it**. If someone asks you what you need, tell them the truth. Be honest and ask for help.
+ **Pause and take time to notice something beautiful that God has created**. Think about His creative power and how He cares for you even more than the birds of the air (Matthew 6:26–30).
+ **Spend 10 minutes a day doing a favorite hobby or physical activity**. Reach out in kindness to another parent. These all help you to experience positive emotions in your busy life.
