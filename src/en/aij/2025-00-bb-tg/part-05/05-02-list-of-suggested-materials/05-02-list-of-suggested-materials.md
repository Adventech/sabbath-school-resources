title: List of Suggested Materials
---

Consider the safety recommendations when choosing the objects and materials for your class, because babies should be interacting with the objects (touching, mostly). You will want to have an object for each baby as suggested in the lessons, but you can start with just one large object that you, as the teacher, can pass around to each baby. This is more appropriate if you have few babies in your class (one to three babies). When you have more than three babies, you will need to have objects for each baby to avoid delays and distractions.

#### ^[Is This Program Flexible?]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})

Yes! For parents who have a baby partway through the year, you can begin with lesson 2 or lesson 3. Alternatively, you may want to begin with lesson 1 midyear and extend the Babies class for 18 months, if needed. Ultimately, these resources are offered to support you and the parents in your church, so use them in a way that is flexible to meet the needs of your church.

#### ^[Materials Reserved for “Early Birds” and “Parent Time”]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})
Reserve two sets of toys so that babies who arrive early have something to play with. Consider having a different set of toys to use during Parent Time. If you have volunteers in your church who are willing to help, they may be able to watch the babies during Parent Time (in sight of the parents) while you carry out the conversation time with the parents.
