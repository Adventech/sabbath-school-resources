The physical atmosphere of your home gives a valuable message in your baby’s education. A bright, tidy, and clean home, along with work and recreational activities that bring peace and are in harmony with the Bible, generate an ideal environment for the development of your child.

Whether your baby has a separate room or if they share a room with other family members, the baby’s space will provide a lot of education for them. They can have a small, ventilated, and tidy space that is bright during the day and dark and quiet during the night. This will help them to rest well in moments of sleep and enjoy sunlight and fresh air during the day. Decorate the space in a simple style. You might like to include a picture of a beautiful nature scene or animals, or a picture of Jesus that you can refer to (a real image, not a cartoon, would be most suitable). Talk to your baby often about how Jesus cares for and loves children, and how He sends an angel to protect them.

The emotional environment of your home is also important. Your baby will understand that Jesus is the center of your home when they hear kind voices or soft music, when they participate in family worship that is appropriate for their age, and when they see their parents pray and express their love to the family members and to each other.

It also helps your baby to have a predictable daily routine that provides security. Caregivers (both fathers and mothers or grandparents) can collaborate with this environment by leading in spiritual moments when possible and organizing the daily routines at home with gentle joy.

Whenever you are doing chores around your child, do them cheerfully and positively and talk about how much you enjoy making your home clean and beautiful for the family. When you show that you enjoy these tasks, you will help your child to see them as positive and enjoyable tasks, and they will be more likely to help you. Remember that everything you do to make your home a lovely place to be is also a gift for Jesus. Whatever we do for our family we are doing for Jesus.

Your little one will greatly benefit from a home environment that has a sense of calm and order. Daily routines and habits help to create this kind of environment. When your baby first arrives home, it will be helpful to reorganize family routines for the benefit of them and the whole family. As soon as possible, establish a routine of regular sleep, feed, and rest time with your baby. This will allow both of you to be rested, and it helps to maintain physical and emotional balance and positive family relationships. Whenever your daily routine allows it, try to enjoy an outdoor walk so your child can experiment with their senses in nature by touching, smelling, hearing, and seeing all that is around them.

As you introduce these home routines, also introduce spiritual routines as soon as possible. Character development is vital in the early years. Prayer (spoken or sung) when getting up and when going to bed and before each meal, family worship, special worship with your baby, and incidental conversations about God are all practices that can be woven into the fabric of your little one’s daily life as they grow. These practices will all be further explored within this book. These routines can make a deep impact on their mind and will lay the foundation for Christ-centered character development.
