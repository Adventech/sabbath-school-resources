Make a Creation Book with your child. Use loose sheets of plain paper to form the book, which can be bound together at the end of the quarter. Each week a new creation day will be added. This week, focus on the cover. Ask your child to think of some of their favorite things that God created. Find and print pictures of animals or plants, or draw these together on the front cover. Then write the memory verse on the front cover.

Use water play to learn about God’s creation. Fill a plastic bin one-third full of water. Provide your child with a variety of items to design and create their own little world: driftwood pieces, aquarium plants, pebbles, twigs, flowers, leaves, and plastic fish and ducks.

Write out the memory verse on a piece of paper and then cut each word up separately. Draw a picture on the back of each word to help your child understand what it says. Hide the word pictures around the room and send your child on a treasure hunt to find them. Once they are found, help your child place the words in the right order and say the verse a few times to learn it. Isn’t God amazing to create such a wonderful world!

### ^[Pray]({"style": {"text": {"typeface": "Omnes-BlackItalic", "color": "#5EB6AD"}}})
Throughout the week, watch for the goodness of God and talk about it with your child. Explore your neighborhood or backyard for the good things God has made for us. As you discover God’s goodness with your child, pause to say “Thank You” to God for each specific thing.

Sing “God Is So Good” or another song that emphasizes God’s love with your child.
