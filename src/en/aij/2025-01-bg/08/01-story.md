In the beginning, before there were lions in a pride or glowing fireflies, there was God. It was Day 5 (five fingers), and God was ready to make the earth come alive. In just four days much had been done. There were coconut trees and a great big sea. God had made the sun to shine bright and the moon for the night. The earth was beautiful and green; but still, no life was to be seen. The stars went out one by one (flicking motion with hands), as the sun came up. Dew sparkled on the grass as the palm trees waved in the breeze. The air smelled sweet of jasmine and strawberries. The waves of the sea rolled onto the sand. The earth was ready for what God had planned. Life was about to arrive on Day 5 (five fingers). As the sun warmed the day, a dolphin leaped in the bay. A school of silver fish shimmered in the light. Graceful manta rays skimmed along the reef, and a gray whale spouted (clap hands together, then up), then dove deep. Sea turtles rode the currents while jellyfish floated on the tide. There was still more God would do on Day 5. God saw (hand above eyes; look about) all He had made, and it was good.

Godâ€™s strong, kind voice echoed across the hills. As He spoke, the sea came alive with creatures of every color and size. Bright blue and yellow fish began swimming to and fro (hand swim like a fish), and an octopus crawled along deep below. A starfish found its place on the rocks while manatees munched on leafy stalks. The water was alive with the creatures of the sea God made on Day 5.

God made all this for you and me! Have you ever been to the sea? There are shells to gather and pretty rocks of many colors. When you walk on the sand, do you like the feel on your toes? Can you find the crabs that walk sideways or the anemones waiting for the tide? Watch closely to see a whale spout or dolphin leap. God made all this wonder of the sea for you and me. He had more to bring to life on Day 5. What do you think is next to arrive?\
(Say together) Thank You, God, for making all the fish!
