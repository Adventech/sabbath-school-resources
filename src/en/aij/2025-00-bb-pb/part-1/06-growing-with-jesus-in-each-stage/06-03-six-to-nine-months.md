title: 6–9 Months
---

Even though not all babies develop at the same rate, you can use the guide below to identify developmental characteristics during the first 12 months of their life. At each stage you will find suggestions of what can be done within your home and sphere of influence to intentionally foster character growth and spiritual development.

Character Development Ideas

At this stage your little one can begin to learn obedience in simple situations in life.

+ **Talk, read, sing, and play** together every day.
+ **Pay attention to how your baby reacts** to new people and situations, making sure that they are comfortable and happy.
+ **Make sure your baby can obey easily** (by removing things from their reach that may be harmful).
+ **Prepare large, safe areas** for them to move and explore.
+ **Put your baby near things they can use as support** for getting up and standing safely.
+ **Observe your baby and stay close as they move**. At this age they will be constantly exploring new movements and games.
+ **Play to take turns**. Use taking turns in daily situations to help your baby develop patience.
+ **Verbalize your little one’s emotions**: “You are sad; let me help you feel better.”
+ **Describe what your baby wants** when they point at something.
+ **Tell them what you want them to do clearly first** (rather than what you don’t want them to do): “Please sit down” instead of “Don’t stand up!”

When your baby obeys, affirm them or clap your hands. When your baby disobeys, shift their attention to something else or, in a dangerous situation, say, “No.” Be aware not to overuse the word “no” in your discipline, as this word doesn’t clearly say what the child should do, but rather causes stress in the brain. It is better to say “yes” warmly and joyfully to the things that the child does right and well, and save “no” for dangerous things, to help protect them. Try to structure the environment and your home to support your child’s good behavioral choices. Check that you have met your child’s needs and that you are not contributing to what may appear to be “misbehavior,” which can sometimes be just exploring.

Ideas for Growing in Jesus

+ **Babies can now enjoy worship that lasts a few more minutes**, including singing songs and playing with objects they can easily hold. Your baby will respond with laughter and happy expressions.
+ **Allow your baby to participate in family worship on your lap**. They can participate as much as possible—holding something, keeping the rhythm while others sing, turning the pages of a book, etc.
+ **Take your little one to Babies Sabbath School and church**.
+ **Share Bible books** with colorful illustrations and explain what each picture shows.
+ **Use Sabbath afternoons to enjoy nature**. Your baby can see the flowers, and animals, or collect rocks. Tell them that everything they see in nature is a gift from Jesus because He loves us.
