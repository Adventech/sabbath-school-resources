Acknowledging and keeping the Sabbath is an important part of what it means to be a Seventh-day Adventist. It is a special day that is different from the other days of the week. When God rested on the Sabbath, He blessed it, He sanctified it, and He made it holy (Genesis 2:2, 3). God asks us to remember the Sabbath every Friday sundown through Saturday sundown so that we can rest from the busyness and pressures of this life, while investing in time with God, worshipping with a community of believers, and being a blessing to those we can serve. We grow in knowledge of Him and His Word, and our love for God grows deeper as we spend time with Him.

So the Sabbath is a day to delight in God’s company. As we do this, He will give us a rest in every way: physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. He wants us to enjoy it for the gift that it is, in all its fullness. To do this, try to plan your week so that it can be a delight for everyone in your home. From a very young age your child can grasp that Sabbath is a unique and very special day. It’s an opportunity to build wonderful memories with God into their little life as they grow. Take time to discover what brings your baby delight and try to incorporate those activities into your Sabbath in an appropriate way.

Here are some ideas to help make the Sabbath a day of delight and remembrance:

+ **Encourage an excited anticipation of Sabbath**. In everyday conversations, express how joyful the Sabbath is as a day to enjoy church, to be with the family, and to help others. For example, you could say such things as “I love singing and praying at church on Sabbath.” “It’s so beautiful to eat yummy food together on Sabbath.” “This Sabbath we can visit our neighbor—she’s so lonely. She’ll love the flowers we bring.”
+ **Every day, count how many days are left until Sabbath**: “Today is Tuesday, and there are four days left until Sabbath!”
+ **Begin to prepare for the Sabbath early in the week**. It’s easy to be so exhausted on Friday evening that you don’t get to delight in the Sabbath yourself. There are things you can do during the week so that Friday is not tiresome and the Sabbath is more relaxed. Pace yourself through the week with Sabbath in mind. For example, you may like to prepare Sabbath clothes on Wednesday and do your food shopping on Thursday, having in mind a plan for Sabbath lunch. In this way you too can find joy in what Sabbath has to offer.
+ **Plan special activities that you can do together as a family**. In the same way you plan for your family’s physical food on Sabbath, plan for their spiritual food. “Let’s bring a special thanksgiving offering to church for Daddy’s birthday.” “We’re going to have a special nature treasure hunt this Sabbath.” “We’ll invite the new family for lunch on Sabbath.” “Let’s color special Sabbath place mats for our table; then we can laminate them and use them every week!” You may like to build anticipation by planning a “Sabbath surprise” to reveal to your child after lunch on Sabbath.
+ **Create special worship traditions** for the opening and closing of Sabbath. You may like to do something unique for these special worships, such as light candles, share spiritual highlights from your week, say words of encouragement to each other, or repeat a special psalm together. What a privilege to spend special time with God on Sabbath.
+ **Choose special music to listen** to as the sun sets on Friday evening. This will help to change the atmosphere in your home to a spiritual one.
+ **Pray a special biblical blessing** over each of your children as part of opening Sabbath.
+ **Prepare delicious healthy meals** that make Sabbath lunch a special meal.
+ **Use special objects at home**, such as a Sabbath tablecloth or fresh flowers.
+ **Prepare a special box of toys** that explore the Bible, nature, and spiritual themes for special use on Sabbath. You could include Bible picture cards, special “heaven” building blocks, Bible games, a magnifying glass, Bible peg people, or plastic animals. Open the box on Friday evening and put it away Sabbath evening so it remains “special.” These materials can be used to explore God’s creation, play Bible games, and become props to help you tell interesting Bible stories.
+ **If possible, take your family into nature** on Sabbath and delight in the wonder of what God has made for us. Look carefully at some plants or animals and thank God for creating them; examine some body parts and their function and thank God for them, too. When we look closely at nature, we come to know our Creator more.

\
\
\+ **Go for a walk** and choose three things for a home “nature art gallery.”\
\+ **Write out some Bible verses on cards**. Have everyone secretly choose one and illustrate it with a drawing. See who can guess which verse inspired the illustration.\
\+ **Invite everyone to praise God** for something in their week. Have Mom or Dad write the praise points on a card and place them in a special container. Read them again at a later time.\
\+ **Take turns writing to each person in your family** a thank-you note or an “I love you because . . .” note on a small card. Use them as place cards on the supper table where each person will sit on Friday evening (small children can dictate their message for an older person to write).\
\+ **Establish some special family Sabbath traditions**, such as having a special meal on Friday evening to celebrate the beginning of Sabbath.
