To help your baby begin to feel God’s love through your love for them, and to help them begin to recognize family worship as part of their daily routine, you may like to try the following ideas:

+ **Sing spiritual songs**.

> “Too much importance cannot be placed upon the early training of children. The lessons learned, the habits formed, during the years of infancy and childhood, have more to do with the formation of the character and the direction of the life than have all the instruction and training of after years”.
