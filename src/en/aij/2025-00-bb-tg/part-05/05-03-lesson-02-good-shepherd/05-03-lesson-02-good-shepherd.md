Note: Your little one cannot understand the meaning of this verse yet, but can work toward memorizing it as they grow. Later, when the meaning is understood, it will make more sense, since it has always been associated with God’s care and the care of their family, as well as with the warm hug, touch, or closeness, and the sense of security.

The baby will:\
**+ Know** that God and parents love and care for him or her as the Shepherd loves and cares for His sheep.\
