_The Alive in Jesus Baby Steps Curriculum seeks to equip both you, as the Sabbath School teacher, and parents at home to introduce Jesus and establish a pattern of devotional habits right from the beginning of life._

This program is designed to facilitate learning on Sabbath morning, as well as throughout the week at home. The repetition of the same themes and stories at home and in Sabbath School will ensure that our babies begin to absorb and recognize the ideas being taught throughout the lessons with repetition and routine.

This program includes four simple stories with familiar themes and objects to lead the little ones to Jesus and His love: Creation, The Good Shepherd, Noah and the Animals, and A Special Baby. Each of these stories (or lessons) is taught for an entire quarter (approximately three months). This may seem like a long time. However, babies forget things easily, and repetition helps them to learn new information. The repetition develops and strengthens the neural connections in their brains so that they can gradually come to recognize patterns, objects, sounds, faces, and people. As the little ones recognize and expand their memories, you will see that they will express delight through facial expressions and gestures when sharing this time with you. At this stage of life, learning occurs mostly through their senses. The baby needs to see objects; hear songs, words, and sounds; and smell, taste, and touch things that are safe for them.

**^[DID YOU KNOW?]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})**: “The plasticity of the brain is permanent. Whenever the brain is exposed to a new sensory stimulus, to new information, particular chemical and electrical reactions that make up a person are triggered. Although at first it may seem momentary and instantaneous, any stimulus that is repeated often will establish a path in the neuronal network. A path that always leaves a mark” (Blakemore and Frith, 2005).
