The Purpose of the Curriculum

The Alive in Jesus Babies Sabbath School program aims to help you establish a pattern of devotional habits right from the beginning of your child’s life. For this to be achieved, the program is designed to facilitate learning throughout the week at home, as well as in the Sabbath School class. The repetition of themes and stories at home and in Sabbath School will encourage your baby to start absorbing and recognizing the ideas being taught through the stories of the Bible.

The program consists of four simple stories with familiar themes and objects to lead your little one to Jesus and His love. Each story (or lesson) is presented for an entire quarter (approximately three months). This may seem like a long time. However, babies forget things quickly, and repetition eventually enables them to absorb the new information. Through this repetition the neural connections in their brain become increasingly developed so that they can gradually learn to recognize patterns, objects, sounds, faces, and people. As your little one recognizes and expands their memory, notice how they express their delight through their facial expressions and gestures. At this stage of life your little one learns through their senses. They need to see objects, hear songs, words, and sounds, and smell, taste, and touch things that are safe for them.

Whenever the brain is exposed to a new sensory stimulus, to new information, particular chemical and electrical reactions that make up a person are triggered. Although at first it may seem momentary and instantaneous, any stimulus that is repeated often will establish a path in the neuronal network. A path that always leaves a mark” (Blakemore and Frith, 2005).
