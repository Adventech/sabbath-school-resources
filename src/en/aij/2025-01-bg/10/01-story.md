In the beginning, before there were baby chicks or noisy crickets, there was God. It was Day 6 (six fingers), and God was about to do something big! On Day 5 the earth had come alive. God had made birds that flew through the sky (lift hand up), and fish that swam and dove (push hands low). The sun shone bright, and the stars twinkled at night, but not a lion or lamb was in sight. As the sun rose, birds sang as they awoke. A gentle breeze blew across the tall reeds and scattered seeds. The fresh smell of mango and pear drifted through the air. The river tumbled into a pool where goldfish swam (swim hand) about in a school. God had a plan much bigger than all this. He was ready to begin Day 6 (six fingers).

God’s strong, kind voice echoed across the hills, “Let the earth be filled with animals” (Genesis 1:24, ICB). As He spoke, a herd of elephants appeared, and from under a rock scurried (scurry fingers) a spotted lizard. A bunny rabbit wiggled its nose while prairie dogs popped up from their holes. A black bear lumbered down the hill, eating berries. God made so many animals, big and small. All this God made on Day 6. As the sun climbed high in the sky, a hedgehog watched a cheetah race by. A cow mooed happily, chewing on grass, while a playful goat scampered past. Monkeys swung in the branches above, while a tall giraffe chewed on a leaf. A lion roared in delight at the view. There was still more to be done on Day 6. God saw (hand above eyes; look about) all He had made, and it was good.

God made all the animals big (hands wide) and small! (Hands closed.) Do you know an animal that lives on the farm? In the jungle . . . the pond . . . the bush  . . . the snow? There are animals that roar, and ones that bark, some that trumpet or wiggle their nose, ones that creep, and some that jump (do each as you read). So many animals, tiny and tall; God made them all. He was not done yet; the best was still to come before the sun set.\
(Say together) Thank You, God, for making the animals!
