title: Classroom Preparation
---

Even if you are not aware of it, the physical and emotional environment of your Sabbath School class has a powerful influence over the learning experience of babies and their parents. “Babies and young children are very perceptive and aware of the feelings and atmosphere around them” (Learning and Teaching, Scotland, 2005).

The classroom surroundings show what you believe and value. A clean floor most probably shows that a clean space is important for the babies to be in (and surely it is an important aspect of safety and hygiene). Other details reflect values you uphold for your babies. Order, comfort, and safety are important aspects of a physical environment that helps to support learning. Here are some ideas that may help provide the best possible environment for the babies and their parents.

### ^[Space]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})

Where possible, choose a special space for the class, even if you have only one baby. Children were brought to Jesus to be blessed by Him, and they can receive His blessing today too.

We should prioritize babies coming into His presence. Some may think babies don’t need to have a special space. However, any effort to lead babies to Jesus is worth our effort and our special attention.

Whether you worship in an open-air church with woven palms for shade, a new church, a home church, or a permanent church building, angels will draw near as parents and teachers bring their babies to Sabbath School.

##### ^[If you do have the luxury of a permanent church building with space for a class for babies, here are a few tips you may want to consider for the space:]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})

+ **It doesn’t need to be a large space** (especially if it’s only one or two babies). A small place may be enough for babies that do not walk. Keep in mind that parents may need to have space for their baby carriers and strollers.
+ **If possible, the space needs to support effective learning**, so it needs to be at least quiet enough so babies don’t get distracted or irritated by other noises.
+ **The space can be clean**, well lit, ventilated, and preferably not too hot or too cold.
+ **The space should be kept in order**; the materials and supplies should have a clean space for storage, preferably in air-tight, labeled containers to keep things clean and well organized, so that you can easily find them every Sabbath and every time a new lesson is taught. They should be out of sight when not being used to avoid distraction.
+ **The space should be as comfortable as possible**. You may choose to have some adult chairs, throw pillows, or cushions as seating on the floor (alternative to adult chairs). Other items to make it comfortable would be storage cabinets (for materials), curtains, a washable mat or rug, painted walls, or wallpaper. Invest in the best you can afford, but remember that babies don’t need much more than your love, care, and attention. Whether you have a grass floor or a carpeted room, if the space is comfortable and safe it will be very suitable.

+ **A bulletin board or visuals for parents** (placed at adult eye level, that can be created and maintained by parents) that includes:
  + A list or pictures of class members.
  + A space for birthdays. (Visual reminders of everyone’s birthdays. You can include parents and teachers too.)
  + A space for missionary projects, in line with worldwide quarterly projects, local church projects, and missionary projects that you design together in your class.
  + A prayer space with requests, gratitude, and more, for parents and teachers.
  + A list of tips and recommendations for/by parents: books to read, magazines, newsletters (local church, departmental, worldwide), articles of interest, websites, online links, etc.
+ **A bulletin board for babies** (it can be placed at the babies’ eye level if they can sit, or at adult eye level so babies can see it from their parents’ arms). It can include:
  + Pictures of each baby in your class or their families. You may even choose to put a picture of Jesus there too.
  + A mirror (for older babies to recognize their own image and parts of their body).
  + Pictures of things related to the story (things from nature, sheep, animals, etc.). Children and animals of the world (things babies can understand or recognize).
+ **A simple backdrop** that is well planned will help to create a beautiful atmosphere and add to the overall message of the lessons. You don’t need to change much of the backdrop when changing lessons. Just keep it simple. Here are some ideas for each quarter:
  + **Lesson 1 (Creation)**: Use a nature backdrop with green hills and a blue sky with sun and clouds. As the Creation story progresses, a mobile of birds may be added, as well as flowers, trees, and other objects. Add objects one by one, so the baby will have time to get used to the new things.
  + **Lesson 2 (The Good Shepherd)**: The backdrop created in the first lesson may be the same for the next lesson, The Good Shepherd. You may want to add some sheep or lambs to the backdrop or find stuffed toys.
  + **Lesson 3 (Noah and the Animals)**: You can add water with blue fabric or streamers. You may also add umbrellas and spray bottles so that the babies can experience the rain falling.
  + **Lesson 4 (A Special Baby)**: For the last lesson, you can add a stable to the same backdrop.

If you don’t have the resources mentioned above, just use whatever is available to you. Even simple backdrops can help to create a fantastic learning environment for babies.

### ^[Purpose of Decorations]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})

Always remember that the environment and the visuals in your class are also teaching tools and must serve the purpose you want them to have. If you are not intentional in your use of them, they may give messages that differ from your purpose. For example, if you are teaching that Jesus made the animals and you decorate with Disney characters, it will create confusion in the baby’s mind, because they cannot distinguish reality from fiction.
Everything the child and parent see in your classroom must lead their minds to the love of Jesus. The purpose of an age-appropriate study of God’s Word in Sabbath School is to lead their young minds to the love parents have for them, just as Jesus has for them. Today we can still use Jesus’ example for our choice of decorations. Jesus presented truth in a simple and direct way. We can use the simple things from nature (as real and safe as possible) to illustrate to parents and babies the immortal truths, and every time they see those things, they can remember Jesus’ words (see chapter 26 of The Desire of Ages).

### ^[Before the Lesson on Sabbath]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})

Prepare as much as you can so that everything runs smoothly and there are no long lapses of time between activities. This is important to keep the babies engaged. Here are some ways you can prepare:

+ Prepare the boxes or baskets with the materials you will need for the class and arrange everything according to the flow of the program’s outline. You might want to create one box per item, or one box for each baby that includes all items, depending on what is easiest for you and the parents/babies in your class. Be sure that all necessary items are available and that your church has purchased whatever is needed.
+ Set the song posters up so that parents can see them. Place the teacher’s program routine in your view.
+ Light the room. Turn on the light, open or roll up curtains, or whatever it takes for the room to be well lit.
+ Make sure all the materials are ready and clean before Sabbath. Establish a routine so you can leave everything ready for next Sabbath. You may choose to do this immediately after the class is finished, in the afternoon, or at another more appropriate time for you and/or your team.
+ Pray together with your assistants and parents who arrive early.
+ Choose the setup of your Sabbath School classroom, depending on your culture and church’s needs. Because of the age group of these babies (birth through 12 months), we recommend that parents hold and interact with their babies (instead of placing the babies in baby seats). Not only does this foster social-emotional connection and positive spiritual moments between parent and child—it invites parents to be invested in this time together.

Parents can be seated on chairs or on cushions on the floor. Either way, the Sabbath School teacher should be able to interact with each baby at eye level.
