**^[MESSAGE]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **God made all things good for me. He loves me.**

This lesson focuses on nature and God’s creation. Many things around us can also be teaching moments and objects. Keep your eyes open and use all the opportunities to reinforce the lesson. However, it is important to designate and dedicate a special time each day for worship and review of the Bible. This will create patterns of life (or habits) that will be important for their future spiritual life. Keep the baby’s attention with the sounds, the objects, and the songs, and follow the sequence below.

#### ^[Additional Suggestions for This Lesson]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})

Use the principle found within Deuteronomy 6:4–9, “A little here, a little there.” Use all these opportunities to teach that God is love by mentioning as often as possible that “God/Jesus gave us things (name the object) because He loves us.”

+ Take time to smell the flowers (in the park, shop, in your home, etc.) and thank Jesus for the flowers.
+ Name colors that you see and point to objects. With toddlers you can play the color game (say a color and have your child point to the object with the color).
+ Take nature walks as often as possible, and point to things that Jesus made and say, “Jesus made . . .” and then “Thank You, Jesus, for . . .”
+ When drinking water, repeat that “Jesus made the water” and say, “Thank You, Jesus, for the water.”
