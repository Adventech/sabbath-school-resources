In the beginning, before there were black-and-white pandas or sweet watermelons, there was God. The week was near the end, as Day 7 (seven fingers) was ready to begin. In six (six fingers) days God created the earth, the sky, and everything in them. He had made the sun and moon, sweet peas, and tall bamboo. There were super-fast cheetahs and monkeys munching bananas; blue birds in the trees, and whales in the seas. Now God wanted to be with Adam and Eve.

Adam and Eve stood in the garden and watched the sun set low. Bright orange and pink lit the sky with a glow. Day 7 began as the stars came out one by one. A pair of owls called “Hoo,” while a frog croaked “Ribbit” on the pond. Two giraffes crunched on leaves in the moonlight. All of God’s creation was ready for a rest. What would God do next?

This day was the most special of all. This day was like a present and would be different from all the rest. God declared the seventh day to be a day of rest, one that would be blessed. God made this day to show His great love so that our minds could turn to Him above. Sabbath is a special time to spend praising Him; a way to say, “Thank You” (hands together) for all He has given. It was Adam and Eve’s first Sabbath in their beautiful Eden home. Did they eat breakfast under a tree loaded with mangoes or sit by the river watching flamingos? They walked along a path with God, wondering at the lion’s roar and how high the eagle can soar (soar hand high like a bird). They thanked Him for the juicy grapes and laughed together at the silly apes. God also taught Adam and Eve many important things about their world and how to trust and obey Him. As the sun sank low, Sabbath would soon end. Adam and Eve knew they were blessed, and thanked God for a wonderful day of rest.

One, two, three, four, five, six (count with fingers) days of Creation. Then seven, the very best! A Sabbath day of rest. A special day to learn of God and His love. Time to spend with family and friends, and time to say, “Thank You” to God above. A day for exploring big mountains or beautiful meadows, to sing songs in church and share a yummy lunch. What do you like best on this day so holy and blessed?\
(Say together) Thank You, God, for the Sabbath!
