Create

Help your child make the Day 6 page of their Creation Book. Use blue cardstock for the sky, artificial grass turf or green paper with lots of cuts for the grass, cotton balls for clouds, and colored paper for flowers. Use foam or felt stickers for animals or cut out some pictures of animals to use to create the scene. Leave space to add Adam and Eve next week.

Care

Have your child help care for pets. Teach them to use soft, gentle hands when playing with or petting them. When approaching others’ pets, demonstrate calm and respect and always ask before approaching or petting. If you don’t have pets at home, pretend to care for some stuffed animals. Talk about the things animals need to have a happy, healthy life.

Explore

Use play dough and plastic animals to create different footprint tracks in the play dough. Have your child guess the animal that left the tracks. Let them create tracks with their favorite animal. Thank God for all the unique animals He made for us to enjoy.
