+ **Speak to your baby** softly and affectionately with a clear voice.
+ **Sing and read to your baby** to entertain and calm them.
+ **Establish a routine for your baby**—encourage them to sleep more at nights than during the day and have a regular schedule. For example, you can follow the feed, wake, sleep pattern.
+ **Pay attention to your baby’s different types of crying** to try to distinguish their physical and emotional needs.

Ideas for Growing in Jesus

To help your baby begin to feel God’s love through your love for them, and to help them begin to recognize family worship as part of their daily routine, you may like to try the following ideas:

+ **Begin daily worship with your baby**, placing them in a similar spot for worship each day. You will also need to pay attention to their attention span and make sure you keep your worship short and simple.
+ **Read to your baby from a children’s Bible**.
+ **Sing spiritual songs**.
+ **Have your baby participate in your family worship** by sitting them on your lap, or your spouse’s lap, or laying them near you and looking at them while you speak about Jesus.
+ **Take your baby to church**.
+ **Take your baby to Babies Sabbath School** if you have one at your church. If not, you may like to start one using your Worship Box (see “Other Tools for Your Baby’s Spiritual Growth”).
+ **Talk and sing to your baby about Jesus’ love** while you feed, bathe, and dress them.
+ **Say grace before meals**, thanking God for your food.
+ **Show pictures of Jesus to your baby**.
