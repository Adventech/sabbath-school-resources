title: 'Lesson 3: Noah'
---

As your baby grows, she will learn that God takes care of her and the things He made. Look for opportunities throughout your day to show and tell her that God cares for her by noticing God’s beautiful nature and reminding your baby that God loves her.

Listen to, and sing along with, the recordings of the songs in the program, which can be found at www.aliveinjesus.info. You may like to begin with just a few songs and props when your baby is very young and increase to more songs when she is older.
