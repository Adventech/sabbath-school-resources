Jesus didn’t just know the Scriptures; He depended on them. He spoke of them not merely as something beneficial, but as something vital to life itself. When weariness and hunger plagued Him in the wilderness and the devil enshrouded Him in clouds of perplexity and temptation, Jesus did not consult His feelings. He did not consult His reason, or His knowledge, or His heart. There was only one thing He knew He could trust. And so He answered the devil not with His own words or thoughts, but with the words of Scripture: “It is written . . .” “It is written . . .” “It is written” (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10). The Scriptures were more than motivational or inspirational to Jesus. They were His lifeline. “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God’ ” (verse 4).

When Jesus was pushed to the brink, He found victory by relying upon the divine inspiration of God’s Word. So it is with us. We must have a power and wisdom greater than our own to navigate the storms and temptations of daily life. We can find this power and wisdom only in God’s Word, the written revelation of “Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God” (1 Corinthians 1:24).

### The Source of Spiritual Life and Power

“Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you” (John 6:53). This mysterious statement was a turning point in the ministry of Jesus. Soon after He spoke these words, many of His disciples “went back and walked with Him no more” (verse 66). What did Jesus mean by saying that we must “eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood”? These words were not to be taken literally, but spiritually, as Jesus later explained, “The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life” (verse 63).

The Word of God is the Christian’s source of life and power. Jesus was saying that without regularly feeding on His Word, “you have no life in you.” The Bible gives valuable information about history, vital instruction regarding salvation and the Christian life, warnings about the future, and a knowledge of the character of God. But even this broad description falls short of the primary function of the Word of God for the disciple of Christ. What is that function? To give life—spiritual life. Without “eating” the Word of God, we have no spiritual life in us.

Consider the following Bible texts, noting the allusions to the spiritual life found in the Word: “The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life” (verse 63). “For the word of God is living and powerful” (Hebrews 4:12). “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4). “Having been born again . . . through the word of God” (1 Peter 1:23). These texts reveal that the Bible is more than a guide for living; it creates spiritual life itself. There is creative power in God’s Word.

When God said, “Let there be light,” there was light. “He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast” (Psalm 33:9). In the same way, reading God’s Word can create a love for spiritual things where before there was none. We are “born again . . . through the word” (1 Peter 1:23). And just as we receive new life from the Word, we must be kept spiritually alive by the same Word. “As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him” (Colossians 2:6). “If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine” (John 8:31, NASB). We must continue to drink the “pure milk of the word” so that we may “grow thereby” (1 Peter 2:2).

### The Devotional Life

Because we need the Bible to maintain spiritual life, we cannot safely pick up or leave off the reading of it on a whim. We must make daily Bible reading a spiritual habit in our lives. If we at first fail to understand or to feel blessed by reading the Bible, we should not be discouraged. If by faith we remain consistent, in time God will fulfill His promise: “The entrance of Your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple” (Psalm 119:130). Daily Bible reading, along with daily personal prayer, is referred to as the “devotional life” because we must be devoted to it. It takes a commitment. It is not optional for us as Christians, because without it our eternal destiny is on shaky ground. We may go to church, be kind to others, and give to the poor, but without regular time in God’s Word there will be a decay of personal spiritual life. Temptation will overpower us, and deception will find us to be easy targets. The Great Controversy says it this way: “Satan well knows that all whom he can lead to neglect prayer and the searching of the Scriptures will be overcome by his attacks. Therefore he invents every possible device to engross the mind” (p. 519).

### Practical Application

The Bible teaches that “all Scripture is God-breathed” (2 Timothy 3:16, NIV). Just as God breathed into Adam to give him life, so when we read “God-breathed” Scripture every morning, it gives spiritual life to the soul. That which is written under the special inspiration of the Holy Spirit is best for our daily devotional reading. We may read other books at other times with great benefit, but while those books may be inspiring, what we read for our daily devotional time should be inspired. We should read what we know to be the voice of God.

In the back of this Discipleship Handbook is a reading plan that will walk you through the entire Bible at a steady pace. Make a commitment to spend at least 30 minutes a day in prayer and study. When we make the devotional life a priority in our lives, we find that His words “are spirit, and they are life.”

After His resurrection, Jesus explained the Scriptures to two disciples along the road to Emmaus. They later said, “Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?” (Luke 24:32). What a privilege is ours! We can pray for the Holy Spirit each morning before reading the Bible. Then Jesus will open the Scriptures to us just as He did to His disciples, and our hearts will burn within us. Today Jesus invites you to hold this precious communion with Him through the living Word of God.

### Principles for Effective Bible Study

_Ephesians 6:17_—“The sword of the Spirit” is “the word of God.” Always compare counsel you receive from others, or impressions you receive in your own mind, with the Bible. If an idea doesn’t agree with the Bible, don’t believe it. “The Spirit and the Word agree” (Faith and Works, p. 88).

_1 Corinthians 2:14_—Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. Pray and ask for the Holy Spirit before studying the Bible.

_1 Corinthians 2:13_—Compare “spiritual things with spiritual.” By comparing different passages of Scripture, let the Scriptures interpret themselves.

_Isaiah 28:10_—“Precept must be upon precept.” Read all that there is on a subject, and base your beliefs on the conclusion that contains the greatest weight of evidence.

_2 Timothy 4:3, 4_—“The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine.” Beware of disregarding the Bible when it doesn’t agree with your habits or lifestyle.

_2 Timothy 3:16_—“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.” Trust the whole Bible. Don’t pick and choose.

_John 7:17, ESV_—“If anyone’s will is to do God’s will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.” Be willing to obey truth as it is revealed.

### A Method for Personal Bible Study

1. Follow a daily reading plan, so you will always have something to read (see appendix B).
2. As you read, ask yourself questions to help you focus on the text and discover practical lessons for your life. Here are some questions you could ask:What? What does the passage say?What does the passage tell me about Jesus or God?What does the passage tell me about the help that God gives?So What? Why is the passage important or relevant?Is the passage convicting me of a sin that God wants me to confess?Now What? Is this passage describing some change that God wants me to make in my life? Is there an example here that I am to follow?Is there a promise in this passage that I can claim?
3. Write in a notebook at least one lesson God taught you from your reading, and how you will apply it to your life.
4. Conclude with prayer, talking to God about what you learned and asking Him to help you live it out.
5. Meditate on those verses during the day, and share with someone else what you learned.
