God paints His beauty on the canvas of the sky differently each day through the times and seasons. Take some time today to drink in the vast beauty of God’s sky. Notice the various patterns of clouds; marvel at the burnished pinks of a sunset or golden hue of a sunrise. Watch a storm gather on the horizon as dark clouds build and then release their showers. 
If God can paint the sky every day with such beauty, what can He do in your life this week? Work deadlines, full washing baskets, and the whirl of always getting somewhere on time are not beyond His care. God loves both order and beauty. The God who created the sky wants to gift you with both. 
Routines and structure are important for both children and adults. A sense of peace can be found in your own daily plans. Knowing what is to come in each day gives a child comfort and safety to explore and learn. But no matter how perfectly ordered your day begins, there will be times you will feel out of control, like a storm brewing on the horizon. How do you respond when your plans seem to disintegrate? Whom do you turn to for your stability and comfort?  
When you show your child that you can calmly adjust to a new course, they too learn how to handle unexpected changes. Together you can ask God to order your plans. Seek His strength to be flexible no matter what arises as you model to your child how to rely on Him. Your anxieties can be eased when you rest in knowing that God holds the world, and your home, in His hands.

> “The same power that upholds nature is working also in man. . . . Only in harmony with Him can be found its true sphere of action. For all the objects of His creation the condition is the same—a life sustained by receiving the life of God, a life exercised in harmony with the Creator’s will”
