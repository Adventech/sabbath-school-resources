title: Spiritual Habits for the Family
---

Though your baby cannot express it, they will be very aware of the time, energy, and joy that you invest in spiritual habits within your home. Family worship, baby worship, prayer, spiritual conversations, Sabbath activities, and engagement at church will all be gradually absorbed. Through these activities your baby will come to sense how important God is in your home and how important other things are: work, your spouse, extended family, money, screen time, friends, and entertainment. Prioritizing family worship, the Sabbath, and church will demonstrate just how important Jesus is to your family. In this chapter we will look at the importance of family worship, the Sabbath, and church and offer some general ideas for how you can make these areas joy-filled in your home. In the next chapter there will be more specific ideas in accordance with your baby’s developmental age.

### ^[Family Worship]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})

Family worship is an important priority. Family worship provides an opportunity for your family to daily welcome God into your home and openly declare your love for Him together. Even if your family consists of just you and your baby, you can begin this tradition together.

A brief, age-appropriate family worship in the morning and evening, or whenever the time is best for your family, will help your family to see that God is important to you and that He deserves praise, thanksgiving, and expressions of love from your family. These worship times will change as your baby grows, but what is important is that you’re acknowledging God as part of your family, and you’re making daily time with Him part of your everyday routine.

Your growing baby might simply hold the Bible while you read, or follow the rhythm while you sing, but simple ways of involving your child will show that worship is an important priority in your home.

Because worship is not a “thing” but something we do, try to do all you can to make it a time of genuine heartfelt expression of love and praise to God that will grow your little one’s friendship with Him.

In the next chapter you will find age-appropriate ideas that you may like to implement for family worship with your baby. You will find a summary of ideas for each developmental stage as your baby grows. (Also see Part 2 of this book for the Sabbath School program, which you can do each day at home, to be reinforced and repeated every Sabbath at church.)

**^[TIP]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})**: Here are some general ideas of how you can make family worship something everyone can enjoy:\
\
**^[Worship Cue]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})**: Babies begin to pick up on patterns and routines, so it’s a good idea to use a consistent cue for worship. This might be a song you sing at the beginning, a special spot or chair you sit on, or a particular activity you do that they recognize each time to let them know worship is about to begin.\
\
**^[Praise Songs]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})**: Choose and sing (or listen to) one or two happy songs—one song for your baby and one happy song for the adults, so that your baby becomes familiar with other hymns and worship songs.\
\
**^[Prayer]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})**: Since your baby has a very short attention span, it’s important for prayers to be short and to the point when you are praying with your child. Avoid repetition and meaningless words. Try to express to God what you want to say in three or four spontaneous and simple phrases. Pray as Jesus taught us to pray, addressing the Father in the name of Jesus.

Deuteronomy 6:7–9 says,\
“You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand. . . . You shall write them on the door- posts of your house and on your gates.”\

Ask God to help you guide your baby to know and love Him. Insert your baby’s name into the following verse as you pray to God in your own prayer time. Lord, help me to teach [your baby’s name] to “love the Lord [their] God with all [your baby’s name’s] heart, with all [your baby’s name’s] soul, and with all [your baby’s name’s] strength” (Deuteronomy 6:5).
