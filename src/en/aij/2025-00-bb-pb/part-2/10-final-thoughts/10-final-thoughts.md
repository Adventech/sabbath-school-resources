title: Final Thoughts

“We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and His strength and His wonderful works that He has done” (Psalm 78:4).

God has offered us a wise way forward as we reflect on what it is to be a godly parent who builds a home where our babies can start to learn about, and love, Him. Keep one eye on the goal, and the other eye on the task at hand—daily building, caring, and protecting. It is by small, daily tasks that we work toward the goal of nurturing our children to love Jesus, their forever friend, so that they can grow to share His love with others.

God has called you to parent your little one. Yes, you have been chosen for this role. No one else can be who you are. No one else can do what you do. Your child needs your love, your joy, your faith, your trust, as your own relationship with Jesus impacts all you do.

As you love and care for your child in your home, may you know, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13) “and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:7).

May you faithfully sow the love and thoughts of Jesus into your little one’s life every day—and when that moment comes (far too soon), when they are all grown up and their wings are stretched and ready to fly, may you say, “Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to Your name give glory, because of Your mercy, because of Your truth” (Psalm 115:1).

“The Lord bless you and keep you;\
The Lord make His face shine upon you, And be gracious to you;\
The Lord lift up His countenance upon you, And give you peace”.\
Numbers 6:24–26
