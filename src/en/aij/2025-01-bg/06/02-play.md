Create

On Day 4 of your child’s Creation Book, cut out light-blue cardstock to fill half the page, and black or navy cardstock to fill the other half. Use yellow paper to cut out a sun and use strips of yellow and orange paper for the beams. Use sparkly star stickers to fill the night sky and cut out a crescent shape for the moon. Write underneath, “On Day 4 God created the sun, moon, and stars.”

Explore

On a sunny day, take your child outside for a few minutes to feel the heat of the sun on the grass, dirt, or pavement, then go inside to feel the cool of the shade. Talk to your child about putting sunscreen on and wearing a hat and sunglasses to help get the right amount of sun but not too much. Thank God for the sun, which helps keep us warm.

Learn

Collect some books from your local library about the sun, moon, and stars. Learn about the stars in the sky and show your child which planet Earth is in the line-up of planets. Research some pictures of stars up close. Cut out the different phases of the moon and glue them together in a line to show what the moon does during the month. What an amazing God to create such a huge universe!

Watch

Plant some flower seeds (like daisies) in a pot and place it on a sunny window. As they grow and bloom, thank God for making the sun to help things grow.

Pray

Go outside and hold your child while you watch the sunset. Talk about the beautiful colors God paints in the sky. When twilight comes, look for the first stars to shine and see how many you can count. As the sky grows darker, look for the milky band of stars called the Milky Way. Talk about how God made the stars and knows each one by name. Share how God knows your child’s name too, and even knows how many hairs are on your head.
