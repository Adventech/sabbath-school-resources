title: 'Lesson 4: Baby Jesus'
---

As your baby grows, he will understand that God loves him. Look for opportunities throughout your day to show and tell him that God loves him too. Sing to him, smile, use kind words, and talk about Baby Jesus.

Listen to, and sing along with, the recordings of the songs in the program, which can be found at www.aliveinjesus.info. You may like to begin with just a few songs and props when your baby is very young and increase to more songs when he is older.

Look for ways to use music, your smile, words, your baby’s name, songs, etc. and show interest in pictures and songs about Baby Jesus. Keep your eyes open and use all the opportunities to reinforce the lesson.

#### ^[Additional Suggestions for This Lesson]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})

+ Play music and create a joyful atmosphere in your home. Use your baby’s name whenever appropriate in the songs. Give noisemakers (child-safe bells) when your baby shows interest.
+ With your baby on your lap, look at Christian picture books about the birth of Jesus (or you can make your own book with old cards or images). Point to each picture and describe what is shown. Use developmentally appropriate pictures with simple, bright colors, without too many details.
+ Place an object in a paper bag and stick your hand in the bag to feel the object. Play “Guess the Object’s Name” or “Peekaboo” (“Hide-and-Seek”).
+ Give your baby a safe and fun time exploring gift-wrap materials. Talk about the objects and about Jesus’ love.
+ Take a photo of your baby and of your family doing different things together (eating, reading books, playing, traveling, etc.). Show it to them and talk about Jesus’ love and care for them and your family.
+ Play simple games with your baby (such as pedaling your baby’s legs and saying, “________, God made your legs so strong!”). When your words, looks, and actions are relaxed and gentle, loving and kind, you are teaching your baby that they can trust you, and, as we have discovered, this is the foundation for your baby’s trust in God.
