What an exciting day the sixth day of Creation must have been! God created animals of every shape, size, and color imaginable. When spending time in nature, pause for a moment and ponder the amazing creativity of God. It is in the animals’ incredible design that we can see the divine nature of God. 

God did not design a monochromatic world, but rather one of rich beauty and variety. Each animal species has their own unique characteristics. The beautiful spots on the snow leopard or the remarkable coloring of the emerald swallowtail butterfly demonstrate God’s desire not only to create for function but also to create a world of wonder and beauty. 

God created the animals as a gift for us to enjoy and to care for. They were originally designed as helpers and companions. While much has changed since sin entered the world, we can still glimpse God’s original design. When we take the time to notice the many incredible things in nature, we learn more about God and His love and care for us. 

Animals provide an appreciation for all God’s creatures and a wonderful opportunity to teach your child about kindness and caring for others. Children can learn much about compassion and being gentle and respectful to animals, whether in the wild or a pet at home. When on a walk, be observant for God’s creatures. Teach your child to watch in wonder and enjoy without disturbing their natural patterns. Take the time to watch a caterpillar cross a path and marvel at the funny way it moves, or to observe a trail of ants busy about their work. God’s love and care for even the tiniest of His creatures is great, but is merely a pale reflection of the greater love He has for each of us.
