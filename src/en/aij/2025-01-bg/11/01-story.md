In the beginning, before there were rhinos or rabbits, there was God. Much had been done at the start of Day 6. God made big elephants and tall giraffes, sweet lambs and strong horses. The earth was filled with the sounds of birds singing and the smell of flowers blooming. God wasn’t finished with Day 6 (six fingers) yet. The sea shone brightly in the sun. Monkeys swung from vines, but there was no one to watch (point to eyes) them climb. Birds sang, but there was no one to hear (point to ear) their song. Leaves danced in the breeze, but there was no one to twirl (twirl child) along. Flowers bloomed, but there was no one to smell (sniff) their perfume. Dolphins played, but there was no one to feel the water spray (flick fingers). God knew Creation wasn’t quite done; the best was to come.

God was excited! He gathered up some dirt into the shape of a man. God made a man to look like Him. He breathed (breathe out) into the man. When the man opened his eyes, He saw God looking at him, smiling with love! God named the man Adam. God brought each animal for Adam to name. None of them looked like Adam. God knew that Adam needed a family of his own. Someone to be his friend; someone to be his wife. So God created a woman named Eve. God married them on that very day. As the sun set low, Adam and Eve walked and talked with God. God saw (hand above eyes; look about) everything that He had made, and it was very good.

God made Adam and Eve, the very first family, on Day 6 (six fingers). They loved each other and worked together in the beautiful garden God had made. They were people just like you and me. They were God’s friends and talked to Him every day. God is your friend too. He loves you very much! (Hug child.) He likes to hear you pray and talk about your day. He hears each song you sing and each “Thank You” you bring.\
(Say together) Thank You, God, for making Adam and Eve!
