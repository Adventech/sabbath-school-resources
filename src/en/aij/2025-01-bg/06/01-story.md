In the beginning, before there were bears that snore or eagles that soar, there was God.  On Day 1 He made the light (one finger). On Day 2 He made the sky (two fingers). On Day 3 He made the land and sea, and grass so green (three fingers). It was now Day 4 (hold up four fingers). God created a beautiful world for you and me. The new day shone as a gentle breeze blew through the trees.  The smell of roses and sweet oranges filled the air. God had been creating a world He wanted to share.  The river tumbled (roll hands in tumbling motion) into the sparkling sea, and the tall grasses danced on the shore.  The time had come for God to show what was to be done on Day 4 (four fingers).

Godâ€™s strong, kind voice echoed across the hills. As He spoke, the Earth became warm and filled with shining light from the sun.  The day was warm and bright as the sky filled up with colors and light. Bright dots sparkled in the night sky as God set millions (expansive motion of arms) of stars to twinkle way up high. He hung the big round moon to shine, reflecting the sun at night. God placed these lights in the heavens to give light to the Earth and to separate day from night.  God saw (hand above eyes; look about) all that He had made, and it was good. Evening passed, and morning came. This was the fourth day.

God made the sun, stars, and moon for you and me. The sunlight makes your skin feel warm and helps you grow. Can you watch the moon change night by night from a silver crescent in the sky to full and bright?  Can you count the stars each night as they begin to shine? God made this Earth so fine. He loves you, and so do I! What would come next on Day 5?\
(Say together) Thank You, God, for making the sun, the moon, and the stars!
