Even though not all babies develop at the same rate, you can use the guide below to identify developmental characteristics during the first 12 months of their life. At each stage you will find suggestions of what can be done within your home and sphere of influence to intentionally foster character growth and spiritual development.

Character Development Ideas

+ **Talk, read, sing, and play together every day**.
+ **Give your baby time to feel comfortable with strangers**. If appropriate for your culture, don’t force them to be with strangers or engage with them if they are not comfortable doing so. Put their emotional needs before the needs of the unfamiliar adult.
+ **When your baby does something they shouldn’t do, say “No” firmly**. Do not shout or give them long explanations. Use praise and encouragement often when they do something well.
+ **Spend more time encouraging things your baby does** well instead of reprimanding them for doing things you do not want them to do.
+ **Talk to your baby about what you are doing**: “Mommy is bathing you so you can be fresh and clean.”
+ **When reading age-appropriate books, let them turn the pages**.
+ **Ask your baby to point out the details in the picture books**, or find the puppy in the picture, etc. Show them the characteristics of the illustrations—colors, sizes, people’s emotions, etc.
+ **Add details to your baby’s attempts to speak**. If they ask for an apple by saying, “a-a,” you can say, “Yes, a red apple.”
+ **Let your little one draw with big crayons and paper**. Encourage them to play with blocks to sort colors and shapes.
+ **Teach your baby songs** that can be rhythmically accompanied by rattles, bells, or music sticks.
+ **Provide safe places to explore**—be aware of plugs, medications, cleaning products, door locks, and anything that threatens their safety.
+ **Play with your baby** to name their body parts or things they see when going for a walk with you.
+ **Clearly tell your little one what is allowed** and what is not allowed. Be consistent.
+ **Make sure everyone in the family understands** what the baby is allowed to touch or not touch and do or not do.
+ **It can be helpful to limit the number of toys your child can play with each week**. Try offering them a few toys rather than everything they own. Put the rest away. They will play with a few toys in a more focused way, as they will be less distracted, and they can learn to put their own toys away more easily when they are a little older. Plus, it will make tidying up even easier for you.
+ **Try to always be consistent with your baby**, with yourself, and with the rest of your family.

Ideas for Growing in Jesus

In addition to what has been identified in earlier stages, your baby can now learn to pray when waking up, eating, and going to sleep.

+ **Keep family worship to a fixed schedule**. Create the expectation of worship as a beautiful moment of enjoyment.
+ **Encourage your little one to hold objects** that relate to the story shared during worship.
+ **Encourage your baby to put their hands together to pray**.
+ **Have them follow the rhythms of the songs with rattles or actions with their hands**.
+ **Get your baby to touch a picture of Jesus as a sign of love**.
+ **Encourage them to participate in family worship on your lap**, so they can learn reverence and enjoy family time. They can participate as much as possible with Bible stories, especially if they have older siblings.
+ **Take your little one to their Sabbath School**.

+ **Read your baby age-appropriate Bible books** with colorful illustrations and explain what each picture shows. Ask them to point to different objects on the pages.
+ **Take your baby to church**. Encourage reverence and worship even from this early age.
+ **Use Sabbath afternoons to enjoy nature**. Your baby can smell the flowers, touch pets, crawl on the grass, and taste fruit. Tell them that everything they see and touch in nature is a gift from Jesus, who made everything because He loves us.

^[Prayer Prompt]({"style":{"text":{"size": "xl", "typeface": "BaskervilleBT-Bold"}}})\
Help (_your baby’s name_) to trust in You with\
all their heart, and lean not on (his/her) own\
understanding. I pray that in all (your baby’s\
name’s) ways (he/she) will acknowledge You and\
allow You to direct (his/her) paths\
(see Proverbs 3:5, 6).
