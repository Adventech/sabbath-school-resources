{"style":{"text": {"color": "#a65726", "align":"center", "size": "lg"}}}
_There are three parts to the Alive in Jesus Babies curriculum, each working together in harmony to strengthen the spiritual development of the babies in your care._

These three parts are: Baby Time (Sabbath School), Parent Time (Sabbath School), and Home Time (as explained in the Parent Book). It is recommended that the Sabbath School time slot at church be split into two parts: Baby Time and Parent Time. Then what is modeled during Sabbath School can be adopted at home too (Home Time).

Baby Time is 20 minutes in the Sabbath School time slot at church. The Sabbath School teacher engages the babies with music, visuals, and stories from the Bible, using the resources and lesson outlines provided in this program (see Part 5). The remaining 30 minutes of Sabbath School time will be allocated to Parent Time.

When you’re teaching babies during Sabbath School, there are some important components to consider:

### ^[Age Bracket]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})

Though this curriculum is intended for babies (0–12 months), it can include older babies and toddlers (12–18 months). If your church has never had a class for babies before, this is your opportunity to start one. If the babies are already 6 months or older, don’t worry—you can start right away! Having six months or more to use this curriculum will be very beneficial for both babies and parents. Discuss with parents about the best time for them to move their baby into the Beginner class, which will have a similar, multisensory, interactive style. Each baby will be different, and it’s important to encourage some flexibility in this regard.

### ^[Engagement and Enjoyment of Learning]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})

Babies have very short attention spans, and it can be challenging to keep them engaged. Here are a few ideas to increase engagement during the learning process:

+ **Observe them carefully to see what they’re engaging with and what they aren’t**. If you find the little ones are absorbed in a particular activity of the lesson, let them enjoy the prop or music a little longer. If they are starting to appear restless, move on to the next lesson activity. Most likely different babies will be responding differently, so keep an eye on all of them as best as you can.
+ **Sit down on the floor** (if able) so you are at eye level with them. They will sense your presence and will be more likely to engage with your facial expressions, hand gestures, and verbal sounds.
+ **The lessons provide ideas for props**. These props will ensure that the babies are enjoying the experience by using all their senses.
+ **Be organized with the props**. Keep them away from their eyesight (to avoid extra distractions), but be ready to use them so there are no long delays in between the lesson activities.

### ^[Music]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})

Babies are especially sensitive to music. Singing and playing music to babies can be a great way to calm, comfort, and teach them. According to the authors of the book Teaching the Faith (Habenicht and Burton, 2004), music is valuable for religious education because it’s a way of worship, learning Scripture, providing variety, and expressing feelings. The most effective way to use music during the class is to introduce only a few songs to begin with, and then sing them every week. You will notice that the lesson outlines (Part 5) will introduce new songs every three or four months. Encourage parents to sing the same songs at home as part of their Home Time daily worship so the melodies and words become familiar to the baby.
  
### ^[Volunteer and Parent Involvement]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})

It is quite possible that the parents will have their hands full just sitting with their baby throughout the class, but they can be included in the lesson as they assist the baby in playing with the props. It’s also a great idea to have the words of the songs displayed in large font so that parents can sing along too. The little ones will love seeing and hearing the moms and dads engage through singing and being actively present. Encourage all parents to see this time with their baby as important, and an opportunity to nurture their baby’s spiritual development through music, interaction, joy, and reinforced Bible messages. Kindly discourage parents from socializing with other parents during the 20 minutes, emphasizing that Parent Time will provide the important connection and support that all parents need.

There are many other components to the Sabbath School class that volunteers can help with, such as playing the music; welcoming parents; preparing, handing out, and packing away materials; keeping records of attendance; decorating the classroom; and praying for families. Use your volunteers according to their gifts and talents so that they will enjoy the experience of being involved.

### ^[The Classroom Environment]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648"}}})

Discuss the best place to hold your Babies class with your church leaders or Sabbath School superintendent. It’s important to have a space dedicated to the babies that you can use regularly. It doesn’t need to be a large space (especially if you have only one or two babies), but it does need to support their learning. The best learning environment will be quiet, clean, well lit, and as comfortable as possible for parents and babies.

You may choose to decorate the room in a simple, organized, and beautiful way. There are ideas on how to do this in Part 4: Preparation.
