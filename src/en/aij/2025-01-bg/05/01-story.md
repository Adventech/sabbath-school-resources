In the beginning, before there were apple trees or honeybees, there was God. God had been busy making a place for you and me. When Day 3 began (hold up three fingers), God moved the water to make dry land. He had made light on Day 1 (hold up one finger) and the sky on Day 2 (hold up two fingers). Still nothing grew, no gardens or flowers, cherry trees or seeds. There was more to do on Day 3, so much more to be seen. A blue stream tumbled down the rolling hills of rich brown dirt. A quiet breeze rippled the water of the sparkling sea. The sky was bright and clear. What would God do next for you and me? (Hold hands out as in a question.)

Godâ€™s strong, kind voice echoed over the hills. God spoke, and soft green grass began to grow. It pushed up through the dirt and covered the hillsides. Flowers burst (closed hands together, then burst up and open) from the soil: purple pansies, yellow sunflowers, and white daisies filled the meadows. Apple and pear  trees and strong oak trees pushed their way through the earth, reaching up toward the sky. Trees stood tall with tasty red apples and sweet mangoes hanging in green leaves. Bananas and coconuts hung from branches in palm trees. Tall sunflowers nodded their heads in the breeze. Orange carrots with their bushy green tops pushed up through the dirt as the tidy rows of a garden began to appear. God saw (hand above eyes; look about) all that He had made, and it was good.

God made a beautiful world full of bright colors to see, sweet flowers to smell, and fruits and vegetables to eat. He gave each plant seeds so more would grow. He made all these good things for you and me. Do you like to eat a crunchy apple or a juicy orange? Do you like to eat tiny green peas or bread made of wheat? God made these yummy foods for you to enjoy and to help you grow. God loves you so! (Hug your child.) What would God have in store on Day 4?\
(Say together) Thank You, God, for making the plants and trees to grow!
