When your baby is about 2 months old (depending on your little one’s engagement and eye contact), catch their attention and say, “Look at this flower” (showing a natural flower or an artificial flower that looks natural). “What a beautiful color! It smells beautiful! I wonder who made the flowers?”

Sing the song “Who Made the Flowers and Trees?” (or “Who Made the Twinkling Stars?”) and show the picture of Jesus (see the back of this book) to your little one to touch. Then hug your baby and tell them that you love them and that Jesus also loves them very much!

Once your baby is able to sit up, you may like to try something new. Sit close, and once again, have visual contact with them. Show them a Bible or a picture of one and say, “This is the Bible. It tells us that Jesus loves us and takes care of us.” Sing: “I Open My Bible.” Show a picture of Jesus and say, “Thank You, Jesus, for the Bible.”

Don’t talk too much. Use words your baby knows and understands. Teach the truth. Remember, worship should be a sweet and happy time so that your little one will associate the things of God with something that feels good.

Make sure that you know the songs well, and, if possible, have the Sabbath School music on a device that you can listen to and sing along with at the right moment. If you don’t have access to such a device, your own beautiful voice will be delightful music to their ears.

Implementing Activities According to Age

{"style":{"text":{"color": "#bf9648", "typeface": "BaskervilleBT-BoldItalic"}}}
Babies 0–3 months:

+ **Find a specific time during the day** that your baby is most awake and not tired, hungry, dirty, or sleepy. If you choose to do this late in the day and you have older children, no doubt they will love to help you. Have your baby at eye level with you. Use a baby chair or car seat to help with this. By looking into your little one’s eyes, you will be able to assess the level of engagement. Babies love to look into their parents’ eyes and watch them light up with joy!
+ **Move to a special place** that you will always use for your baby worship. Make sure it is well lit and without distractions or people passing by.
+ **Babies who are 0 to 3 months old have a very short attention span**. At the beginning, your little one will not be able to focus on all the short phrases you speak, even though they take less than a minute. However, keep repeating them daily. Start with only one song and one phrase and repeat it every day for several weeks until you can see that they recognize the song (this will eventually happen if you do it at the same time every day). You will notice that they will gradually pay attention for a few more seconds.
+ **When you notice that your baby can hold their attention** during this first part, introduce another sentence from the program outline, and another song. Keep repeating and expanding in keeping with your baby’s attention. The length of the program will always be determined by your baby’s attention, following the same sequence, using the same words, and singing the same songs.
+ **Use short sentences, and make the time primarily about the music**, your gentle voice, tone, and loving touch. Use the same words, objects, sounds, and songs. The more you repeat, the more your baby will enjoy what is to come.
+ **Model prayer early**. Place your baby’s hands together and pray with one or two short phrases. For example, always address God, “Dear Father . . .” and end “. . . in Jesus’ name.” Afterward, make a pause and say “Amen” slowly. Then, when the baby is ready to speak, the word “Amen” may well be one of the first words in their vocabulary.
+ **As your baby grows, they will love the routine**. Follow the program outline order and go at a pace slow enough for them to follow you. Take enough time for them to be engaged in each song and activity. Stop or change the activity before they get restless (being restless means their attention span is over).
+ **It’s valuable to remember that the process of this worship time** (the atmosphere and tone) will be even more important than the content at this early stage. Your emotional messages will be stronger than your verbal messages, so the way in which you connect with your little one will help them experience the kind of love that will prepare them to know and experience God’s love. With this in mind, try to relax and be free from tension, so that you can be fully present and really enjoy these precious moments. If you are feeling bored, try to add something interesting or change some elements. Boredom or stress from you may show, and your little one, with their keen ability to perceive emotions, will be able to sense it. Make a warm and sincere connection with your baby your first priority. Show your baby how beautiful it can be to spend time with Jesus every day.
+ **If someone else is taking care of your little one every day**, invite them to conduct this special worship time.
+ **You may also like to sing these songs incidentally** throughout the day as you notice something that relates to one of them.
+ **If you have other older children at home**, try to set aside a special time (about five minutes) to have one-to-one time with your baby, speaking quietly about God’s love. You will still want to have worship together as a family, but this is your special time, to bond closely with just your little one.

Babies 3–6 months (with previous experience):

+ **Continue with the program outline** as you have been doing so far, gradually including new phrases and songs as their attention allows.
+ **As your little one grows and their routine changes** (for example, they stay awake longer, need more or less activities, move more, etc.), you will invariably need to adjust the time. However, try to be consistent and keep to your regular routine. It will be a precious moment for you to be able to connect with your baby and teach them about God’s love.
+ **Watch for indications of “learning” through your little one’s reactions**, facial expressions, the odd word or two, or their attempts to sing the songs from the program. Begin a gradual transition from one story to the next. This is more important the younger they are, as it provides security in the process.
+ **With a consistent and faithful routine**, you will discover that by the sixth month your baby will respond to your worship time with smiles and will be able to pay almost constant attention for about five minutes.

Babies 6–12 months (with previous experience):

+ **If your baby has experienced regular worship** as part of their daily routine, the program will have grown in length by now, so you may choose to leave out one part and introduce another, without varying the initial structure. This slow transition offers security for your little one. It will be helpful if the variations you introduce mirror what is happening in Sabbath School.
+ **Since babies around 6 to 12 months can sit and hold objects**, take advantage of these skills and give them something to hold during worship time. They will also make sounds and can begin to learn to follow rhythms.
+ **Enjoy!** As your baby grows to be a toddler, they will start doing the actions and later sing some of the words until they can follow the complete song. Remember to sing slowly, as the song is for your child, not for you. Enjoy seeing them grow! Share with your Sabbath School teacher the little milestones of growth so they can celebrate with you.
