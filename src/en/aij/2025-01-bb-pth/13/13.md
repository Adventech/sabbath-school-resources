**Reflect**

Time and time again in God’s Word He invites us to come to Him. God invites us to bring our joys and our sadness, our victories and our stress. Whatever we are experiencing in life, He is there with us. He will be with us always (Matthew 28:20). Ellen G. White shares, “Prayer is the most holy exercise of the soul” (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 201).

**Pray Together**

Praise God for who He is and offer thanksgiving for what He has done for you in recent times. Then pray for the needs of those in your group.

**Pray Praise**

“If more praising of God were engaged in now, hope and courage and faith would steadily increase” (Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 202).

- Praise God for what He is doing in your life and your baby’s life.

**Pray Needs**

“Take to Him everything that perplexes the mind. . . . Nothing is too great for Him to bear” (Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 100).

- Hand over your worries and concerns to God in prayer and let Him take care of them.
