One of the most important life skills you can teach your child is to seek God every day in personal devotion. Although your child is now only 1, 2, or 3 years old, it’s not too early to begin teaching them how to do this in simple ways. 

**How can I begin to teach my Beginner child to turn his or her heart to Jesus?**
 
1. **PRAY**: Every day, pray for your child’s heart to be opened to Jesus. 
2. **IN THE EVERYDAY MOMENTS**: Look for opportunities to talk about Jesus and how much you love Him. Sing simple songs about this and teach your child to sing along with you. Spontaneous, authentic praise at this age is an important part of building faith. 
3. **YOUR DEVOTIONAL PLACE**: Choose a chair, windowsill, or regular place where you will daily read your Bible and pray. Do this in a visible part of your home, such as the living area, so your child sees you spending time with Jesus. 
4. **YOUR CHILD’S DEVOTIONAL PLACE**: Not too far from your Bible study space, create a place for your child to spend time with Jesus. Spread a small mat or towel on the floor, along with a few simple Bible picture books (remove toys and other distractions). Make sure that your child is not tired or hungry during this time, so it is a pleasant time they look forward to.  
5. **TIME WITH JESUS**: Explain to your child that every day, at this same time, you are both going to spend time with Jesus. This will be quiet time, during which you will read, pray, or sing to Jesus. Show your child how they can look at the pictures in the Bible books and think about the stories. Explain that when Mommy/Daddy spend time with Jesus, your child will spend time with Jesus too. You won’t talk or read stories together during this time, although you can do this later! To begin with, spend two to five minutes of individual time, depending on their ability to sit still and focus. Gradually increase the time as your child gets older.
