title: 'Baby Steps: Growing with Jesus Curriculum Resources'

#### Parent Book

The aim of the book Baby Steps: Growing With Jesus is simple: to encourage parents in their parenting, to give them ideas, and to equip them with practical strategies to nurture the spiritual life of their baby. In the latter part of the Parent Book are four simple story programs. These programs will be mirrored at home (one per quarter). Each day, when their baby is content, parents can follow the simple worship ideas. These same ideas will be repeated every Sabbath at Sabbath School. The repetition is beneficial for babies as the stories and songs are repeated every day at home and every week at Sabbath School.

#### Teacher Guide

This resource equips Sabbath School teachers with a program and with the information needed to lead the Babies Sabbath School class each week. This program is the same program that is outlined in the Parent Book.

#### Parent Time Handouts

Weekly handouts for parents or caregivers on topics that help educate and inspire. After the 20-minute program for babies at the beginning of Sabbath School, parents can gather to spend 30 minutes discussing, sharing, and praying. Each parent will be given a weekly Parent Time handout, which can be discussed together as a group. Parents can take the handout home to further reflect, discuss with a spouse or friend, and keep these weekly handouts as a resource for future reference. The goal of these Parent Time handouts is to grow both your personal relationship with God and equip you with additional ideas for raising your child.

**^[Parent Time: Sabbath School]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})**: _(30 minutes)_ Parent Time is a spiritual workshop in which parents join together to explore spiritual parenting topics. A weekly handout is given to each parent. One parent can lead the discussion, based on the prompts, activities, and discussion questions. Babies can either stay with the parents during this time, or, for a more focused discussion, be cared for by two or more volunteers.
