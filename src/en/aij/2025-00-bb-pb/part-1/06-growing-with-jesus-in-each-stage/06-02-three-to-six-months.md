Character Development Ideas

To help your baby feel loved and cared for, and to help them consolidate their daily routine of sleeping, eating, and playing in their world, you may like to consider the following ideas:

+ **Show joy!** Hug your baby and play with them while you feed, bathe, and dress them.
+ **Establish a routine for mealtime and bedtime**. Adjust it as they spend more hours awake during the day. Emphasize that days are for playing and nights are for sleeping.
+ **Pay attention to the things your baby likes and does not like**, so you can know how to satisfy their needs and make them happy.
+ **Learn to recognize your baby’s moods**. If they are upset, comfort them.
+ **Play, with the purpose of repeating what your baby does**.
+ **Repeat the sounds your baby makes with simple words**. For example, if they say “ma,” you may say, “Mama.”
+ **Give your baby age-appropriate toys**, such as rattles or colorful illustrations. Keep them nearby in a safe place so that they can grab them or kick them without any risk of injury.
+ **Play peekaboo**.
+ **When your baby sees something, point it out and describe it**.
+ **When your baby drops something, pick it up and give it back**. They will learn about the cause-and-effect relationship.

Ideas for Growing in Jesus

^[Prayer Prompt]({"style":{"text":{"size": "xl", "typeface": "BaskervilleBT-Bold"}}})\
Father in heaven, may (_your baby’s name_) delight\
in Your law, and learn to meditate on it day and\
night so (your baby’s name) becomes like a tree\
planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth\
its fruit in its season (see Psalm 1:2, 3).
