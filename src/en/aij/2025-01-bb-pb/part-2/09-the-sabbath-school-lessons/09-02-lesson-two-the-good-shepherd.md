**^[MESSAGE]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **God cares for me.**

This lesson focuses on God’s care for us. Use every opportunity in which you care for your baby (feeding, bathing, dressing, etc.) to remind your baby that just as you love them, God loves us and cares for us.

**^[BIBLE STORY]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})** **The Good Shepherd**

Note: Your little one cannot understand the meaning of this verse yet, but can work toward memorizing it as they grow. Later, when the meaning is understood, it will make more sense, since it has always been associated with God’s care and the care of their family, as well as with the warm hug, touch, or closeness, and the sense of security.

#### ^[Additional Suggestions for This Lesson]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})

+ During the day, point out God’s care. When you care for your baby, say, “Mommy/ Daddy cares for you; Jesus cares for you too.” Do it during feeding time, bathing time, when baby is tired, or hurting or crying, or any other opportunity. Keep reminding your baby that Jesus cares just as you care. Show your little one your own personal thankfulness to God for His care.
+ You can continue thanking Jesus for all that He gives you (food, shelter, family, etc.). Thanking God for tangible things is more relevant for your baby than pictures or words. Thank God for things that they can see and touch.
