For your baby to grow spiritually, an important foundation needs to be laid in the early years. This foundation is made up of three important lessons for your baby.
They must learn:

1. To feel loved and to love
2. To trust their loved ones
3. To obey


### ^[Love]({"style":{"text":{"color": "#a65726"}}})

In the book _Child Guidance_ Ellen G. White writes, “The first lesson that children are to be taught is that God is their Father. . . . That God is love is to be taught by every lesson” (p. 487). When your baby feels loved, they will also naturally learn the love God has for them and how to love others. Setting this important foundation in the life of your baby is the most important thing you can do. Thankfully, in the first year of your baby’s life, it takes only very simple interactions through voice tone, eye contact, touch, and dependable care to communicate love. It is the simple things such as feeling the comfort of your closeness and warmth, smiling, talking to them with tenderness, feeding them when they’re hungry, or cuddling them when they’re upset that will communicate love to them. Even picking up a toy repeatedly and patiently whenever they drop it is a special game that strengthens your bonds and demonstrates your love. In essence, giving your baby time, attention, and care is giving them love. Donna Habenicht in her book How to Help Your Child Really Love Jesus says:

> “All through early childhood, learning about love means having parents who are ʻtuned inʼ to their child’s needs. They listen to the child’s emotional broadcasting station so that its needs come in loud and clear, and they respond appropriately. . . . ʻTuned-inʼ parents give their children an overwhelming message of love. Their children know Mom and Dad are on their side. And that is the fundamental message of God’s love: He’s on our side all the time, walking beside us, encouraging us, even carrying us in moments of extreme despair. Your children discover the nature and reality of spiritual love by experiencing your love” (pp. 9, 10).

Your investment of time through the simple interactions of life will set your baby up to be a well-loved and loving child who understands their worth and value in the eyes of God.

**Prayer Prompt**

- [ ] Read through 1 Corinthians 13:4–7.
- [ ] Pray through the attributes of love mentioned and ask God to help you love like He loves. You can also add 1 Corinthians 16:14 to your prayer and ask the Lord to “let all that you do be done in love.” Think specifically about how to love your baby, but also pray about loving others in your home (spouse, other children), and ask God to place His love in your heart so that you can share His love with those around you.
