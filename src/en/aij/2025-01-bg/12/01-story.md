In the beginning, before there were owls that “hoo” or chatty cockatoos, there was God. God created the earth for me and you. On Day 1 He made light, and on Day 2 He made the sky. On Day 3 the grass and flowers grew. On Day 4 He made the sun, moon, and stars, and on Day 5 He made the fish and birds come alive. On Day 6 God made animals—rabbits and hippos (count each day with fingers). God saw all of this, and it was good! God saved the best for last. When the earth was ready, He made a man and woman. All of this was long ago, but God knew one day there would be you. When the time was perfect, He made you—wonderful you! (Hug child.) You were created exactly right— amazing in His sight.

Look in the mirror. What do you see? (Give child mirror.) Do you see your eyes? (Count 1 . . . 2.) Your eyes are (color) just like mine (or mine are ____). God made you with (light/dark) hair and mine is _____. Can you wiggle your nose? Where are your ears? Count them: 1 . . . 2.  Can you make your mouth look happy . . . sad . . . silly? God made you as beautiful as can be!God made eyes for seeing fluffy white clouds in the sky. What do you see? (Put hand over eyes as you look around.) He created ears for hearing birds singing in the trees. Listen . . . what do you hear? (Cup hand over ear.) He made fingers for feeling the soft fur of a kitty. What do you feel that is soft? (Have child bring you something soft, bumpy, rough, smooth.) He created mouths for tasting juicy strawberries. What do you like to taste? He made noses for smelling sweet roses. Sniff, sniff . . . what do you smell with your nose?

Each one of us is different, yet God loves us just the same. Whether you have 10 toes to wiggle or a happy giggle, feet for walking or marching to a beat, legs that leap like a frog or jump up and down, hands that clap or a voice to sing, each part of you is special indeed. (Do with child as you read.) God gave you exactly what you would need. You are perfectly designed for the wonderful plans He has in mind.\
(Say together) Thank You, God, for making ME! God had finished His creation. What would He do on Day 7?
